### This is not the main repo for the competition. Please whatsapp any bugs found. Here we will aggressively use AI which may modify the original competition repo and because we don't want merge conflicts we have created a new repo. This repo is just for reference using which we will modify our main repo. The "looks" may not be the same as we want so please check original repo in between. 

# Testing

- in backend folder create a new file .env and dump contents matching .env.example
- open terminal in the root > npm install (root) > cd backend > npm install (backend) > cd .. > cd frontend > npm install (frontend) > cd .. (come back to root)
- npm start
