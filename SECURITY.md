# 🔐 Scroll2Ship Security Policy

At **Scroll2Ship**, we take the security of our platform and our users seriously. As an e-commerce service, we recognize the potential risks that vulnerabilities can pose to customer data, transactions, and business operations. This policy outlines how we handle security issues and how you can report them responsibly.

## ✅ Supported Versions

Scroll2Ship is under active development, and we prioritize security and safety fixes for the most recent production version deployed on our servers. We do not maintain older versions unless there is a compelling reason and sufficient resources to support a backported fix.

- What is the nature of the bug or vulnerability? Which part of Scroll2Ship is affected?
- Do you have a proof-of-concept or evidence of the vulnerability being exploited?
